Mud baths serve several important purposes for elephants.  Under the hot African sun, elephants lack sweat glands to cool down effectively. The mud acts like a natural sunscreen and insulator, helping them regulate their body temperature. The mud also helps to loosen and remove dirt, parasites, and dead skin cells, keeping their skin healthy.  So next time you see an elephant luxuriating in a mud bath, remember it's not just a spa day ‚Äì it's a vital part of their survival strategy! #elephantcare #natureisamazing",
